/**
 * Tesbo reporter for Playwright — Basecamp 10189985971, build sequence item 2.
 *
 * Usage in `playwright.config.ts`:
 *
 *     reporter: [
 *       ['list'],
 *       ['@tesbox/playwright-reporter', { projectId: process.env.TESBO_PROJECT_ID }],
 *     ]
 *
 * and tag each test with the case it validates:
 *
 *     test('user can reset password', { tag: '@tesbo.testId("TES-1042")' }, async ({ page }) => {});
 *
 * Four constraints from the card shape the implementation:
 *
 * - **One run per session, never per test** (§4). `onBegin` opens exactly one run.
 * - **Untagged tests are skipped and counted, not fatal** (§3). `strict: true` opts into failing at
 *   collection time instead; the default keeps a suite mid-adoption working.
 * - **Never break the customer's CI** (§7). Every ingest call resolves; `TesboClient` logs and
 *   counts failures rather than throwing. The process exit code is left entirely alone — see the
 *   closing note.
 * - **Non-blocking submission** (§7). `onTestEnd` starts the submission and returns immediately;
 *   the promises are collected and drained once in `onEnd`, so result posting never sits in the
 *   critical path between two tests.
