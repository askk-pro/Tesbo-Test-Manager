/**
 * Tesbo MCP — protocol types.
 *
 * The "Tesbo MCP" card ships an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server as an in-process
 * module inside Tesbo-Backend-Nest, exposed over an HTTP transport (see mcp.controller.ts).
 * MCP is JSON-RPC 2.0; this file defines the small slice of the wire format we implement
 * (initialize / tools/list / tools/call / ping) plus the internal tool-registry shape.
 *
 * Design note: this is a dependency-free implementation of the JSON-RPC/MCP surface rather
 * than a wrapper around @modelcontextprotocol/sdk. The protocol layer is tiny and keeping it
 * in-tree makes the whole thing unit-testable without a running app or DB — which matters
 * because the Playwright e2e suite cannot boot in the build sandbox.

export const MCP_SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Tesbo is a test management system. This server exposes one project's test cases, suites (folders), test cycles (test runs), executions (a test case's result within a run), bugs, and a separate Knowledge Base (folders + documents) — always scoped to the project this token was issued for.

Typical shapes:
- Test cases live in suites (list_suites, list_testcases with suiteId).
- A cycle is a test run: create_cycle_from_testcases seeds it with test cases, each becoming one execution; record results with record_execution_result / bulk_record_execution_results.
- A bug can link to a test case, a cycle, and/or a specific execution (create_bug/update_bug's links, link_testcase_to_bug/unlink_testcase_from_bug) — linking a failed execution to a bug sets that execution to Failed.
- The Knowledge Base is a separate document/folder tree, not part of the test-case hierarchy — start with search_knowledge_base or list_knowledge_folders.

Rules worth knowing before calling a write tool:
- To archive/restore a test case, use archive_testcase/restore_testcase rather than setting status directly — restoring always resets status to "Draft" (the prior status isn't retained).
- update_testcase and update_suite only change the fields you pass; every other field keeps its current value.
- bulk_update_testcases only accepts priority, suiteId, status, ownerId, automationStatus — not the full field set update_testcase supports.
- Every id-addressed tool is already scoped to this token's project; passing an id from another project fails with a clear "not found" / "belongs to a different project" error rather than acting on it.

Example workflow: "file a bug for the test case that just failed" → get_testcase_executions or list_executions to find the failing execution, then create_bug with links: [{testcaseId, cycleId, executionId}].`;
