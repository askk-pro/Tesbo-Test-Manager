/**
 * Automation ingest — a framework SDK reporting results into an existing project.
 *
 * Basecamp 10189985971. The shape of this service is set by three decisions taken before any of
 * it was written, each of which rules out an easier implementation:
 *
 * 1. **Results land on `cycles` / `cycle_items` / `executions`, not on a parallel model.** An
 *    automated run is a run: it shows up in the runs list, the traceability matrix, the execution
 *    reports and a test case's own history, because it is the same rows those already read. The
 *    alternative — the `Tesbo*` reporting client that used to sit unused in the frontend — keyed
 *    results on spec name + test name and stored them outside `cycles`, which is both the
 *    name-matching the card's §3 rules out and a silo nothing else in the product can see.
 *
 * 2. **Cases are linked by `testcases.external_id`, never by test name or file path.** Card §3:
 *    name-matching "breaks silently on refactors, and produces results attached to the wrong case
 *    with no visible error". `external_id` is UNIQUE per project and is what `tesbo.testId("…")`
 *    carries.
 *
 * 3. **Automation never creates a test case.** Card's positioning note: QA engineers own, write
 *    and approve test cases; automation only reports results against cases that already exist. An
 *    unknown case id is reported back to the caller as unknown — it is not helpfully conjured
 *    into existence. Attaching an *existing* case to a run is not the same thing and is done
 *    freely (see recordResult).
