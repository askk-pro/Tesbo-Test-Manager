/**
 * Enforces the read-only lock on projects beyond the Launch allowance, once a former Pro
 * workspace's grace window has closed.
 *
 * Applied globally rather than at each call site: there are ~67 mutating routes under
 * /api/projects/:id, and a per-handler check would be forgotten by the next route added. A guard
 * covers all of them and any future ones by construction.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow:
 *   - Safe methods pass untouched, so locked projects stay fully READABLE. Customers can always see
 *     and export their data; this restricts changes, it never withholds anything.
 *   - DELETE on the project itself passes, because that archives it (see deleteProject) and archived
 *     projects don't count toward the limit. Without this exemption the advice to "archive another
 *     project" would be impossible to follow — the lock would be inescapable without paying.
