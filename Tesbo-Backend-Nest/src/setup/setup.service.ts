## Authentication Screens
| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Welcome / Landing | First screen; entry point to login or registration |
| User Registration | New users create an account |
| Login | Existing users access their account |
| Forgot Password | Users request a password reset link |
| Change Password | Users update their password from their profile |

## Core App Screens
| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Dashboard | Main screen after login; shows today's habit progress and counts |
| Create Habit | Form to create a new habit |
| Habit List | Shows all user habits with search and filter options |
| Edit Habit | Update an existing habit's details |
| Habit Details | Full information about a single habit including streak and completion history |

| Weekly Report | Habit performance for the current week with day-wise breakdown |
| Monthly Report | Long-term habit performance with best streak and completion rate |

## State and Utility Screens
| Screen | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Empty States | Guidance screens when no data exists (no habits, no results, no reports) |
| Error and Validation | Inform users when something goes wrong with clear actionable messages |`

    await this.insertDemoKnowledgeBaseItem(client, organizationId, projectId, rootFolderId, userId, "Habit Entity – Rules and Validations",
      `# Habit Entity – Business Rules and Validations

## Required Fields
- **Habit Name** – mandatory on both create and edit; must not be blank
- **Frequency** – mandatory; defines how often the habit should be performed
- **Start Date** – mandatory; habits must not appear on the dashboard before this date

## Optional Fields
- **Category** – selectable but not required
- **Reminder** – optional toggle; if enabled, the reminder time field becomes required
- **Difficulty** – defaults to Medium if the user does not select a value

## Habit Status Values
| Status | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| Active | Appears in today's dashboard list and counts toward reports |
| Paused | Hidden from dashboard; reminders not sent; skipped in report missed counts |
| Deleted | Removed from all lists and views; not shown in any report |

## Streak Rules
- Streak increments when a habit is completed on consecutive calendar days
- Missing a day resets the current streak; the longest streak value is preserved
- Undoing a completion on the same day reverts the streak to its prior value

## Daily Completion Rules
- A habit can be completed at most once per calendar day
- Completion status persists across page refreshes
- Undo is only available on the current day and reverts the habit to pending`

## Registration Validation
- All fields (Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password) are mandatory
- Email must be in a valid format
- Password and Confirm Password must match
- Duplicate email registration is not allowed; a clear error must be shown
- Successful registration redirects the user to the dashboard

## Login Validation
- Email and Password are mandatory
- Login is only allowed with valid registered credentials
- Invalid credentials must show a clear error; no technical details exposed
- Already logged-in users should not be shown the login screen
- Successful login redirects the user to the dashboard

## Forgot Password
- Email field is mandatory and must be in a valid format
- If the email is registered, a reset instruction message is shown
- If the email is not found, a generic message is shown (no disclosure of whether the account exists)

## Change Password Rules
- All three fields (Current, New, Confirm New) are mandatory
- The current password must be verified before the change is applied
- New Password and Confirm New Password must match
- New password must comply with the platform's password strength requirements
- After a successful change the user can log in with the new password; the old one is invalidated

## Session Rules
- Sessions expire after a period of inactivity
- Protected screens must redirect unauthenticated users to the login screen
- Logout must end the session and redirect to the login screen`

## Weekly Report
- Displays data for the selected week; defaults to the current week
- Groups progress by day showing a 7-day view
- Metrics shown: total completed habits, total missed habits, completion percentage, day-wise breakdown, and habit-wise breakdown
- Data is scoped strictly to the logged-in user
- Shows an empty state message if no activity exists for the selected week

## Monthly Report
- Displays data for the selected month; defaults to the current month
- User can navigate to previous months using the month selector
- Metrics shown: best streak, overall completion rate, total completed, total missed, and habit-wise monthly summary
- Deleted habits are excluded from all reports
- Shows an empty state message if no activity exists for the selected month

## Data Consistency Rules
- Paused habits during a period should not count as missed days in reports
- Deleted habits must not appear in any report view
- Report data should update in real time when habit completion status changes
- Only the logged-in user's data must be shown; cross-account data must never appear

## Edge Cases to Test
- Switching between months with and without data
- Habits that were active for part of the month then paused
- Streaks that span across week or month boundaries`

## Empty States
Each empty state must show a clear message and, where applicable, a call-to-action to guide the user.

| Trigger | Expected Empty State |
|---------|---------------------|
| No habits created | Message indicating no habits + Create Habit button |
| No habits for today | Message indicating nothing scheduled + Create Habit button |
| No search results in habit list | Message indicating no matching habits |
| No report data for the selected period | Message indicating no activity data available |
| No achievements earned | Message + hint on how to earn the first badge |
| No reminders enabled | Message + guidance to enable reminders on a habit |

## Error Cases
All errors must be presented with user-friendly language. Raw technical messages must never be shown.

| Scenario | Expected Behaviour |
|----------|--------------------|
| Invalid login credentials | Clear error on the login screen; user stays on the screen |
| Registration with duplicate email | Error indicating the email is already registered |
| Required field missing | Inline validation error; form not submitted |
| Invalid email format | Inline validation error highlighting the email field |
| Password mismatch (registration or change password) | Inline error indicating the passwords do not match |
| Unauthorized access attempt (no session) | Redirect to the login screen |
| Session expired mid-session | Redirect to login with an appropriate expiry message |
| Server or data load failure | Friendly error message; app must not crash; no technical details shown |

## Key Principle
Error messages must be clear, actionable, and written in plain language. The user should always know what went wrong and what to do next.`
